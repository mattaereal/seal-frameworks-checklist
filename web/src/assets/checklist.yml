  intro: >-
      Communities are at the heart of many Web3 projects, but they also present significant security risks. 
      Attackers frequently target community managers, moderators, and users through phishing, impersonation, 
      and social engineering. A compromised account can quickly become an attack vector for broader scams. 
      This section provides best practices to secure community platforms such as Discord, Telegram, Twitter (X), and Google.

  checklist:
      # -------------------------------
      # General Security Practices
      # -------------------------------
      - point: Enforce Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            Require 2FA for all administrators and moderators on community platforms. 
            Prefer authenticator apps or security keys over SMS-based methods to prevent SIM swapping attacks.

      - point: Use Unique, Strong Passwords
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            All community team members should use long, unique passwords stored in a reputable password manager. 
            Never reuse passwords across multiple platforms.

      - point: Educate Members on Phishing Attacks
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            Clearly communicate that official team members will **never** send unsolicited direct messages (DMs). 
            Phishing attacks often impersonate admins, moderators, or support accounts.

      - point: Regularly Audit Permissions and Roles
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            Frequently review and update permissions for all roles to enforce the principle of least privilege. 
            No one should have more access than necessary.

      - point: Use Cold Admin Accounts for High-Risk Actions
        priority: Advanced
        details: >-
            Designate a separate **"cold" admin account** with minimal exposure for performing critical actions 
            such as changing settings, revoking permissions, or handling security incidents.
            
      - point: Establish Clear Communication Protocols
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            Define and document how official announcements will be made and through which channels.
            Educate community members on how to verify authentic communications.

      - point: Create an Incident Response Plan
        priority: Advanced
        details: >-
            Develop a documented plan for responding to community security incidents including
            account compromises, scam attacks, and impersonation attempts.

            and remove your phone number.

      - point: Enable 2FA on Twitter
        priority: Essential
