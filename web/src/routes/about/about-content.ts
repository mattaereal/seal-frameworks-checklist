  `The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive overview of security frameworks and standards to help organizations improve their security posture and compliance efforts.`,
  `
  This checklist is a living document that summarizes key security frameworks and standards from authoritative sources.
  It will be updated regularly to reflect the latest frameworks, compliance requirements, and industry best practices.
  This is made possible by open sourcing the content and making it a community maintained resource,
  meaning that anyone can suggest changes, make additions, or update the guidance.
  All edits are then reviewed by maintainers before being merged and going live.
